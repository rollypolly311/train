Dear Jocelle,

I will be availing of the voluntary separation package provided by Amkor. My last day here is at October 18, 2024

i remember Amkor gave me around 250k this last June or July, which i will give back as this year was not finished.

please help me answer some questions.
1. the amount given to me this 2024, i can give back thru check in the next two weeks
2. the amount given to me last two years 2022 and 2023 will i need to give back?
2.1 i remember its taxable, can you advise how much needed to give back less tax.
2.2. and can i request the amount to give back just to be deducted to the separation package amount that i will receive
3. What department can i send the 250k check that i need to give back

hoping for a positive reaponse.
thank you for the help
Regards,
Ebet
